# Contributing to Hermes-core

Hermes-core is an open-source software licensed with GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. It is maintained by [Cossack Labs Limited](https://www.cossacklabs.com) and we highly encourage you to: 

  - Report bugs and submit request features via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cossacklabs/hermes-core/issues).
  - Report bugs and fix them with patches via our [GitHub Pull request](https://github.com/cossacklabs/hermes-core/pulls) (after issuing a corresponding issue and leaving a link to pull there).
  - Provide your feedback on Hermes-core. There is a certain design scheme according to which we'd like to keep developing Hermes and if your contributions fall along with it, we'd be more than glad to accept some fundamental additions. It's better to discuss the subject using [email](mailto:dev@cossacklabs.com) before taking action. 

Every commit that goes into the master branch is audited and reviewed by somebody from Cossack Labs, don't get discouraged if its approval or rejection takes a bit long - we'll get to it eventually. 

## "I'd like to help somehow, but don't know what will be useful. What should I do?"

If you're looking for something to contribute to and gain our eternal respect (or something more tangible - you might be in for a surprise when contributing to us, who knows ;), just pick the things in the [list of issues](https://github.com/cossacklabs/hermes-core/issues). 

If you'd like to do independent parts (implement new procedures/objects, do a language wrapper or a set of examples for languages or architectures we don't have and don't even plan yet) - just go ahead and let us know when you finish. 

If you'd like to participate in the core development more closely, get in touch. 

## Getting in touch
