# Hermes core library 0.5 PoC

Hermes is novel way to store and protect the data cryptographically, which enables you to add CRUD permissions to data blocks via cryptographic process, where server running Hermes can't do anything worse than DoS. 

Scientific paper and a number of descriptive documents are in progress. In the meanwhile, you can read [wiki](https://github.com/cossacklabs/hermes-core/wiki) for simplistic description.

This repository holds public PoC version, which should be used to study and verify the methodology and cryptographic backend. If you'd like to use Hermes commercially, there is commercially licensed version available.
