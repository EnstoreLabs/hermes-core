# Hermes core library 0.5 PoC

Hermes is novel way to store and protect the data cryptographically, which enables you to add CRUD permissions to data blocks via cryptographic process, where server running Hermes can't do anything worse than DoS. 

Scientific paper and a number of descriptive documents are in progress. In the meanwhile, you can read [wiki](https://github.com/cossacklabs/hermes-core/wiki) for simplistic description.

This repository holds public proof-of-concept version, which should be used to study and verify the methodology and cryptographic backend. 

There is a separate, commercial licensed Hermes version for industrial use (it's core crypto code is equal to this repository, yet it holds additional convenience interfaces and services). 

Hermes is a part of backend protection suite called [Toughbase](https://www.cossacklabs.com/toughbase/).
